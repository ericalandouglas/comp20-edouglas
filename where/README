I believe I have properly rendered the red line with train schedules, 
found the closest red line station to me, and plotted Waldo and Carmen
on the map, calculating how far away they are from me. I believe I have
met all requirements asked on the Assessment portion for this assignment.

I received help from the TA Trevor Rothaus to complete this assignment.

I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
