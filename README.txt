This repository was for a Web Programming class at Tufts University Department of Computer Science, during the Spring 2013 semester. 
It was taught by Ming Chow.
My favorite assignment was creating a frogger game for assignment 4.
I am most proud of Assignment 5 because I managed to launch a simple yet tangible web app using different technologies such as express,
heorku, node, mongodb, etc.
I have learned a lot during this course including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other web technologies necessary to design and develop
applications for the web.
