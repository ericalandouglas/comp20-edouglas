Comp 20 Assignment 2: Frogger, Part 1
2/13/2013

I have correctly implemented all the basic requirements for the frogger game. Additionally I have also
implemented the following extra features:
1. I have implemented a timer, and the additional game scoring extra time feature.
2. I animate frogger to the dead png when he dies
3. I have added a fly that appears at random in the lily pads with proper score updates
   on a successful collision with frogger.
4. Minor updates include naive level progression (simple change of log/car speed and spawn rate), animated
   frogger movements, and inclusion of turtles in the water as well.

I have not collaborated with any one for this assignment.

This assignment took me about 8 hours to complete.
