Comp 20 Assignment 2: Frogger, Part 1
2/13/2013

I have correctly rendered all required images on the canvas. My code is structured in a way to allow for easy integration into part 2. I wrote an initializer function for the canvas as well as a redraw function that I will use later on in an animation function. I declared the game parameters I need for all these functions globally.

I have not collaborated with any one for this assignment.

This assignment took me about 2 hours to complete.
