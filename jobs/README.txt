I use AJAX properly to request a JSON object from another web page. 
I display correctly all companies offering positions in the correct 
format on my html page if the JSON object request is successful.
I display an error message on the screen if the request for the JSON
object is unsuccessful.

I received help from Trevor John to complete this lab.

This assignment took me 30 mins to complete.
